<p>All cue sports are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor
games from outdoor stick-and-ball lawn games (retroactively termed
ground billiards), and as such to be related to troco, croquet and
golf, and more distantly to the stickless bocce and bowling. The word
"billiard" may have evolved from the French word billart, meaning
"mace", an implement similar to a golf club, which was the forerunner
to the modern cue. The term "cue sports" can be used to encompass the
ancestral mace games, and even the modern cueless variants, such as
finger pool, for historical reasons.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in addition to the three general subdivisions listed
earlier, a now rare obstacle category was prevalent in early times. The
obstacle games (see illustration to the right, featuring a croquet-like
variant), appear to have been the earliest,[citation needed] and
include the obsolete bagatelle and pin pool among many other
variations, some with elaborate structures (likely inspirational of
miniature golf), and yet others on a sloped table (the ancestors of
pinball), up to the relatively recent bumper pool (popular in the 1970s
in home game rooms).</p>

<p>The object of obstacle games varies from avoiding obstructions and
traps, to hitting or passing through or into them on purpose to score,
to using them strategically to score in some other way, such as by
rebounding off them to reach a hole in the table or trapping opponents'
balls.</p>

<p>The early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of
the carom or carambole billiards category ? what most non-US and non-UK
speakers mean by the word "billiards". These games, which once
completely dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in
most areas over the last few generations, are games played with three
or sometimes four balls, on a table without holes (or obstructions in
most cases, five-pins being an exception), in which the goal is
generally to strike one object (target) ball with a cue ball, then have
the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the cushions and strike a
second ball. Variations include three-cushion, straight rail, balkline
variants, cushion caroms, Italian five-pins, and four-ball, among
others.</p>

<p>Over time, a type of obstacle returned, originally as a hazard and
later as a target, in the form of pockets, or holes partly cut into the
table bed and partly into the cushions, leading to the rise of pocket
billiards, especially "pool" games, popular around the world in forms
such as eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool and one-pocket amongst
numerous others. The terms "pool" and "pocket billiards" are now
virtually interchangeable, especially in the US. English billiards
(what UK speakers almost invariably mean by the word "billiards") is a
hybrid carom/pocket game, and as such is likely fairly close to the
ancestral original pocket billiards outgrowth from 18th to early 19th
century carom games.</p>
